I have a problem with procrastination. 
More specifically, I have a problem with procrastination in my personal life.
Which I find quite frustrating because I'm generally on top of things at work.

Because of that, I've told myself for a long time that I actually don't have a problem
with procrastination, I just don't have time right now, I'm tired or whatever else.

Sometimes that is actually true, but after taking time this summer and Christmas holiday just to reflect 
about my life goals and what I actually want to do, I realized I have a big problem with procrastination.
Take this blog for example, I've been meaning to get this site up and running since I bought the domain in the fall of 2018!

What eventually got me to write this blog post was a newsletter from James Clear called "[3 ideas, 2 quotes, 1 question](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1)",
which I highly recommend you check out.

The [August 29, 2019 newsletter](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/august-29-2019) talked about making the most of your life
and had this idea which blew my mind:

>“You know yourself mostly by your thoughts.
>Everyone else in the world knows you only by your actions.
>Remember this when you feel misunderstood. You have to do or say something for others to know how you feel.”

This really got me thinking about sharing more. Sharing more of my thoughts, what I'm learning and projects I'm doing.
To do that however, I need to overcome my problem with procrastination.

Practically what that means is implementing the ideas from two books I bought last year:

1. [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits)

I listened to this through audible this summer, it has great practical content, I just need to put it into practice.

2. [The End of Procrastination](https://www.amazon.co.uk/End-Procrastination-Stop-Postponing-Fulfilled/dp/1250308054)
![The End of Procrastination]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/post_images/procrastination.jpg)

Funnily enough, this book has been sitting on my desk for a few months now and I've just read the first chapter,
now its time to stop procrastinating on reading a book about how to stop procrastinating! :)

### What does this all mean for you?

This means you can expect to see a lot more from me as I write about things I'm learning and projects I'm working on.

To start with, I'm adopting a new motto to help me overcome some perfectionistic tendencies: **finished is better than perfect!**
